# MyToken Smart Contract

## Create a Token

### This Solidity program demonstrates how basic minting and burning of tokens works using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this program is to introduce basic token management functions, providing an easy-to-understand foundation for more complex blockchain projects in the future.

## Description
### This contract is a simple implementation written in Solidity, a programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes two key functions: mint, which allows the creation of tokens, and burn, which allows the destruction of tokens. The contract tracks the total supply of tokens and the balance of tokens for each user.
